# aao :: Sorting Algorithms Analysis
[para Português clique aqui](https://github.com/ddangelorb/aao/blob/master/README.md)

When we develop an algorithm to fix a problem it is essential to ask the quality of this algorithm, we should ask ourselves: Apart from fix the problem, does the algorithm take a reasonable execution time? How long does the algorithm execute and what is its complexity? How can we improve this algorithm? Algorithms Analysis Studies give us the answears to these questions in a teorical and pratical manner.

One important field of Algorithms Analysis Studies is Sorting Algorithms. There are many techniques around Sorting Algorithms with many studies in the last decades, improvements and even new proposals. This project aims to run experiments around Sorting Algorithms and its execution times using the methods: BinaryInsertionSort, BubbleSort, BucketSort, CountingSort, HeapSort,
InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, RadixSort e SelectionSort.

All documentation is written in Portuguese, but I do believe it's easy to figure out the methods and main idea here ;-)
