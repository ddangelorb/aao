aao :: Sorting Algorithms Analysis [para PortuguÃªs clique aqui] (https://github.com/ddangelorb/aao/blob/master/README.md)

When we develop an algorithm to fix a problem, it is essential to ask the quality of this algorithm, in other words, we should ask ourselves: Apart from fix the problem, does the algorithm take a reasonable execution time? How long does the algorithm execute and what is its complexity? How can we improve this algorithm? Algorithms Analysis Studies give us the answears to these questions in a teorical and pratical manner.

One important field of Algorithms Analysis Studies is Sorting Algorithms. There are many techniques around Sorting Algorithms with many studies in the last decades, improvements and even new proposals. This project aims to run experiments around Sorting Algorithms and its execution times using the methods: BinaryInsertionSort, BubbleSort, BucketSort, CountingSort, HeapSort,
InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, RadixSort e SelectionSort.
